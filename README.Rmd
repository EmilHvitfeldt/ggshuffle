__ggshuffle__ is a RStudio-Addin that uses the [rstudioapi](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudioapi) package and provides a GUI to give a visual tool to determine if your [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) charts appearance if affected by the order in which your points/lines are being plotted.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")

```
## Example

__ggshuffle__ can be used by highlighting some ggplot2 code and clicking the `ggshuffle` button in the Addins tab or by passing a ggplot2 object to the `ggshuffle()` function.

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
## basic example code

ggg <- ggplot(na.omit(txhousing), aes(volume, median, color = year)) +

ggshuffle(ggg)
```
